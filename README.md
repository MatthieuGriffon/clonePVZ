# Plants vs Zombies Clone

This project is a simplified clone of the popular game Plants vs. Zombies, implemented using the LOVE2D framework. It aims to replicate the core mechanics of planting defensive plants to stop an onslaught of zombies from reaching your home.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need to have the LOVE2D framework installed on your machine. You can download it from [the official LOVE2D website](https://love2d.org/).

### Running the Game

Once you have LOVE2D installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MatthieuGriffon/clonePVZ
Navigate to the cloned directory and run the game with LOVE2D:

bash
Copy code
cd PvZ
love .

Gameplay
The game follows the basic principles of Plants vs. Zombies:

Planting: Click on a plant icon to select it, then click on the garden grid to plant it.
Shooting: Peashooters automatically shoot peas at zombies within their detection range.
Zombie Movement: Zombies move from the right to the left. They lose health when hit by a pea.
